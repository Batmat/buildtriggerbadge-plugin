** By job as an exception?
* Think about supporting less standard causes?
** In that case, the code'll need to be refactored so that we don't throw
   an Exception if the class is not in the classpath.
 
* Sometimes, the wrapper variable (BuildTriggerBadgeAction:l56) can be null.
  Seems like PluginWrapper wrapper = Jenkins.getInstance().getPluginManager()
		.getPlugin(BuildTriggerBadgePlugin.class); 
  can sometimes return null.
  I wonder if this is something than can be only happen during dev using hpi:run and fast-changing classes,
  of if this is something we should watch out...
  At least, during dev, it sometimes ends up with having a lot of NPE in the logs.

* Add a limit to the number of displayed icons. Sometimes, the plugin could display more than 5 icons which can produce confusion in the use of the plugin and Jenkins.
This situation may occur when the build queue is important in Jenkins.

* Unit/integration/whatever test build, image presence etc. Particularly, as of https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15307 we should automate checking behaviour with jenkins deployed as a root Webapp or a more classical one.
