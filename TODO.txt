* Add an option to be able to de/activate that plugin
** By job as an exception?
* Think about supporting less standard causes?
** In that case, the code'll need to be refactored so that we don't throw
   an Exception if the class is not in the classpath.
 
* Sometimes, the wrapper variable (BuildTriggerBadgeAction:l56) can be null.
  Seems like PluginWrapper wrapper = Jenkins.getInstance().getPluginManager()
		.getPlugin(BuildTriggerBadgePlugin.class); 
  can sometimes return null.
  I wonder if this is something than can be only happen during dev using hpi:run and fast-changing classes,
  of if this is something we should watch out...
  At least, during dev, it sometimes ends up with having a lot of NPE in the logs.
